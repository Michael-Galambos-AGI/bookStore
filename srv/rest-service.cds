// With the KeyAsSegmentSupported capability, the service accepts requests to get single resources with the ID provided as path segment,
// for example GET /weather/CurrentWeather/12345. This is a more REST-like way of reading resources by key,
// in contrast to ODataâ€™s special syntax (GET /weather/CurrentWeather(12345)).
